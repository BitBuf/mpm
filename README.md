# `mpm` - Minecraft Package Manager

**MPM is a fiddly way to launch Minecraft from the command line; basically a package manager for Minecraft versions.**

It can be used to work with Minecraft 100% headless-ly, in conjunction with mods such as [HeadlessForge](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/HeadlessForge).

## Installation

Java 8 or newer must be installed and `JAVA_HOME` set in order to install and use MPM.

1. **Download and extract the latest [zip distribution](https://github.com/iBuyMountainDew/mpm/releases) to wherever you'd like.**
2. **Add the `bin` directory in the extracted folder to your `PATH`.**
3. **Verify the installation by running `mpm -V`**.

## Usage

See the [wiki](https://github.com/iBuyMountainDew/mpm/wiki) for usage and package development instructions.
